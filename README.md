# real_time_clock_stm32f103c8
Designing a digital real-time clock with stm32f103c8 microcontroller
In this project, we do:
+ Design a digital clock use STM32 Microcontroller
+ Microcontroller communicates with RTC DS1307 through I2C Protocol
+ Display data about currrent time and date on LCD 1602 through I2C Protocol on the same I2C bus.
+ Set time to activate alarm
+ Decide to activate alarm or not when preset time is reached
+ Store alarm time and alarm active status when power is lost
